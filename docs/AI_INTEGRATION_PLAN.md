# AI Integration Plan

> AI comes after Phase 4. AI never publishes directly. AI always needs human/admin approval.

---

## When

**Phase 6** — After syllabus (Phase 3) and repeated questions (Phase 4) are complete.

AI integration is NOT active in Phases 1–5.

---

## What AI Will Do

1. **Generate RQ drafts** — AI analyzes past papers to suggest repeated questions
2. **Assist with notes** — AI helps draft study notes from syllabus content
3. **Suggest categorization** — AI proposes tags and categories for uploaded papers

---

## What AI Will NOT Do

1. **Publish directly** — All AI content requires human/admin approval
2. **Replace human judgment** — AI is a tool, not an authority
3. **Access user data** — AI operates on public content only
4. **Make approval decisions** — Only admins approve content

---

## Approval Flow for AI Content

```
AI generates draft
  → Marked as "AI-generated" (never hidden)
  → Sent to admin review queue
  → Admin approves, edits, or rejects
  → Only approved content becomes visible
```

## Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| AI comes after Phase 4 | Need real data and approval system first |
| AI never publishes directly | Trust and accuracy |
| All AI content labeled | Transparency |
| Human approval mandatory | Quality control |
| No AI before approval system | Prerequisite |

## Current Status

**Not started.** No AI features exist in the codebase. Any premature AI references should be removed or clearly marked as future plans.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|

| [PHASES.md](PHASES.md) | Phase system — what we're building and in what order |
| [DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md](DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Repo structure, data flow, and folder purposes |
| [UPLOAD_PIPELINE.md](UPLOAD_PIPELINE.md) | Upload flow from file selection to admin approval |
| [ADMIN_APPROVAL_FLOW.md](ADMIN_APPROVAL_FLOW.md) | Admin approval as the single source of truth |
| [SYLLABUS_AND_RQ_PLAN.md](SYLLABUS_AND_RQ_PLAN.md) | Syllabus system and repeated questions plan |
| [AI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md](AI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) | AI integration — when and how (not now) |

## Archived

Previous documentation (Phase 9.2 era) is preserved in `docs/_archive/` for reference only. Those docs are **not authoritative**.

## Rules

1. No extra docs beyond this list
2. Every change gets logged in TIMELINE_LOG.md
3. Phases are sequential — no skipping
4. AI comes after Phase 4 — no exceptions

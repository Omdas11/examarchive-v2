      <h1>About ExamArchive</h1>

      <p>
        ExamArchive is a <strong>student-driven academic archive</strong> created to
        preserve, organize, and make university examination papers easily accessible —
        especially for students studying on mobile devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is built with the assistance of <strong>AI tools</strong>, used as
        development support. All architectural decisions, data organization, verification,
        and academic direction are <strong>human-guided and reviewed</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        ExamArchive began as a personal initiative to solve a practical problem faced by
        students: scattered and unreliable access to previous-year question papers. It
        continues to evolve as a structured and maintainable academic archive.

      <h2>Transparency</h2>

      <p>
        ExamArchive is developed using modern web tools and workflows, including
        AI-assisted development. AI is treated as a <strong>support tool</strong>, not
        an author — responsibility for structure, accuracy, and content decisions
        remains human.

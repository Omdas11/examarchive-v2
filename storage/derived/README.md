# Derived Content

**Status**: 🔮 Future Ready (Phase 7 Architecture)

This directory will store **generated, reproducible content** created from raw academic sources.

## Purpose

Derived content is automatically generated by pipelines (AI or manual) and can be regenerated if needed.

## Rules

1. **Reproducible**: Can be regenerated from raw sources
2. **Never Manually Edit**: Fix source or pipeline, then regenerate
3. **Schema-Driven**: Must follow locked JSON schemas
4. **Versioned via Pipeline**: Track which pipeline version created content

## Admin Approval

**All derived content requires admin approval before publication.**

Draft content lives in `/admin/review-queues/` until approved, then moves here.

## Current Status

**Not yet in use** - derived content currently in:
- `/data/syllabus/` (syllabus JSON)
- `/data/repeated-questions/` (RQ JSON)

Migration will occur during Phase 9+ implementations.

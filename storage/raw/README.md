# Raw Academic Sources

**Status**: 🔮 Future Ready (Phase 7 Architecture)

This directory will store **authoritative, immutable academic sources**.

## Purpose

Raw sources are the single source of truth for all academic content in ExamArchive.

## Rules

1. **Never Modify**: Raw files are immutable after upload
2. **Preserve Original**: Keep exact formatting, quality, metadata
3. **Version Control**: If corrections needed, upload new version with suffix
4. **No Deletions**: Archive instead of delete

## Current Status

**Not yet in use** - PDFs currently stored in `/papers/` (legacy structure).

Migration will occur during **Phase 8** implementation.

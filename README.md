# ExamArchive v2

> A modern, community-driven archive of university question papers.

## What It Is

ExamArchive is a static web application where students can upload, browse, and download university question papers. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and powered by Supabase for auth, database, and storage.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Static HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS — no framework, no build step
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Single SQL setup** — 6 ordered scripts in `admin/sql/`

## Role Levels

| Level | Role | Access |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Visitor | Browse approved papers |
| 10 | User | Upload papers |
| 50 | Reviewer | Approve/reject submissions |
| 80 | Moderator | User management |
| 100 | Admin | Full access |

## Upload Flow

1. Authenticated user uploads a PDF → saved to `uploads-temp` bucket
2. Submission row created with `status = "pending"`
3. Reviewer approves → file copied to `uploads-approved`, status updated
4. Paper appears in Browse page

**Demo papers** skip review and appear immediately.

## Auth & RLS Flow (Phase 2 Stabilization)

Authentication is strictly enforced at the upload boundary to prevent NULL `user_id` violations:

### Client Singleton Pattern

All code must use the `getSupabase()` singleton from `js/supabase-client.js`:

```javascript
const supabase = window.getSupabase ? window.getSupabase() : null;
if (!supabase) {
  throw new Error('Supabase not initialized');
}
```

**Never use:**
- `window.supabase.createClient()` directly
- `window.__supabase__` (deprecated, for backward compat only)
- `const supabase = window.supabase` (this is the SDK, not the client)

### Upload Guard

1. **Auth Ready Check** — Upload button is blocked until `auth:ready` event fires
2. **User Verification** — Before any insert, `supabase.auth.getUser()` is called
3. **Hard Block** — If no user or auth error, upload is rejected immediately
4. **User ID Lock** — Only the fresh `user.id` from `getUser()` is used for insert

### RLS Policy

The `submissions` table has a row-level security policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "users insert own submissions"
ON submissions FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This prevents:
- NULL `user_id` inserts
- Users inserting submissions for other users
- Unauthenticated insertions

### Error Handling & Debug Panel

The debug panel (🐛 icon) classifies errors with color-coded borders:

- **[AUTH]** — Blue border (#2196F3) — Authentication/JWT errors
- **[RLS]** — Red border (#f44336) — Row-level security policy violations
- **[STORAGE]** — Orange border (#FF9800) — Storage bucket/upload errors
- **[CLIENT]** — Purple border (#9C27B0) — Client initialization errors

Errors are auto-prefixed based on message content for clarity.

If RLS blocks an insert, the user sees:
> "Upload blocked by permission policy. Please re-login."

### Debug Panel Auth Status

Open the debug panel (🐛 icon at bottom) to view:
- Session Status: Logged In / Not Logged In
- User ID: `xxxxx`
- Role Level: `10` (User), `50` (Reviewer), etc.

This is logged:
- On page load
- When debug panel opens
- At upload start

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up a Supabase project — run SQL scripts from `admin/sql/` in order
3. Update `js/supabase.js` with your project URL and anon key
4. Serve with any static file server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
5. Open `http://localhost:8000`
